# DBDLobby-SilentHill
Source code +.pak file of my full 1:1 recreation of the Silent Hill lobby (4.1.2).

Since multiple engine updates, the Silent Hill lobby is no longer available for use in the current engine version of Dead by Daylight (UE4.27) <br>
This mod aims to recreate every single aspect of the lighting (vegetation, meshes, lighting, particlesystems etc.) 1:1 as it was in 4.1.2. 

Included is the source code to my mod, so you can see how it was created. You can also modify this any way you would like to. <br>
Also included is a cooked .pak file for just drag/dropping it into the /Content/Paks folder of Dead by Daylight.
