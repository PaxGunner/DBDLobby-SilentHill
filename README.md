# DBDLobby-SilentHill
Full recreation (1:1) of the Silent Hill (4.1.2) Lobby in Dead by Daylight

V1.1 of the Silent Hill Lobby mod is available in the Releases tab (.pak file) <br>
Please note this is a WIP version of the lobby and is missing a few fixes.

NOTE: If BHVR removes very specific blueprints/materials, it's possible something in the lobby may break (textures not displaying / meshes missing) <br>
If this happens I will try my best to recreate the blueprint from scratch.

V1.1 UPDATE:

- fixed crashing when trying to use the lobby
- added missing chain swing animations to various chains
- added missing light & flickering light on the Silent Hill sign
- improved Barbed Wire material

In a future update I hope to add: 

- Silent Hill Menu Music
- Update Ground Material to 3.6.0 / 4.1.2 (currently, it is using 3.0.0)
- Use 1:1 SkyLight method
