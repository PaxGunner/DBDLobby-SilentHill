# DBDLobby-SilentHill

Full recreation (1:1) of the Silent Hill (4.1.2) Lobby in Dead by Daylight

V1.3.1 of the Silent Hill Lobby mod is available in the Releases tab (.pak file) <br>
Please note this is a WIP version of the lobby and is missing a few fixes.

NOTE: If BHVR removes very specific blueprints/materials, it's possible something in the lobby may break (missing textures/meshes) <br>

V1.1 UPDATE:

- fixed crashing when trying to use the lobby
- added missing chain swing animations to various chains
- added missing light & flickering light on the Silent Hill sign
- improved Barbed Wire material

V1.3.1 UPDATE:

- added missing T_SkyLight2 texture cube from Killer_PostProcessVolume
- added missing PostProcessVolume3_0 from Lobby_Lighting
- added missing AmbientCubemap & AmbientCubemap Intesity
- fixed new lobby camera system overriding old camera positions
- fixed crashing & updated lobby to be compatible with 7.5.0+
- readded missing FogGradient components & certain fog settings that got reset when I reinstalled UE
- enabled missing checkbox that caused shadows to not spawn in the lobby
